# Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) Petitpotam and ntlmrelayx to Domain Admin

# Background

I was on a recent engagement in a large AD environment of a large corporate business. There was a number of domain controllers, along with seperate ADCS servers used for signing and assigning certificates within the domain. This attack path used petitpotam (CVE-2021-36942) to coerce a domain controller within the active directory environment into authenticating with it's machine account - E.G DC1$ - to an attacker-controlled Kali Linux instance. Ntlmrelayx was then used to relay the machine account authentication to the ADCS server within the environment, in order to obtain a certificte for the domain controller machine account. This could then be used to either generate a kerberos ticket or to extract the machine account NTLM hash to dcsync a domain controller within the environment.

# Steps to replicate

The first step is to find the ADCS server(s) within the domain, this may reside on a domain controller, or on a seperate server instance. Certipy "https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy" can be used to find ADCS server details with the following command:

```shell

```

On Kali Linux (or any similar distribution), run Impacket's ntlmrelayx with the following command in a terminal window

```shell
ntlmrelayx 
```
