# Penetration-Testing and Red Teaming

A repository of general notes created by a security consultant to help people new to the field of penetration testing and red teaming.  This repository is aimed at people looking to get into a career as a penetration tester, along helping anyone looking to pass the Offensive Security OSCP/OSEP or PNPT exam.  The resources that are listed on here have been curated from a number of online sources and books, to act as one point of reference. This is very much work-in-progress and I will add to this repository as frequently as I can.
